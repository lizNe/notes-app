# Notes Application
## Introduction
<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78036222/161260048-e4b838b4-9d0d-4e9c-9d08-abb3a3c31a6d.jpg">
Notes-app is a work in progress. This application will allow users to create, read, update and delete multiple notes and store them in the program. A menu will appear to the user giving a list of numbered options to choose from. When the usre selects one of these options the user will be asked to input the properties of the note such as: Note Title, Note Priority, Note Category and isNoteArchived, a boolean value that can be set to false to archive the note and set to true to have the note active when a note has been succesfully added to the program. These notes can then be listed with their property and value to the user. A user can simply press the delete note option to permenantly delete a note from the program. A note already added to the system can be updated which will prompt the user to enter the details they wish to update.<br/><br/>
Over the next couple of week more functionality, features will be added along with vigourous testing and debugging of the app being carried out.

## Features
- Using CRUD to create, read, update and delete notes that are stored in the program
- A skeleton menu has been added and a more advance menu will be added at a later date
- A utility package containg a Scanner class is user to read user input rather than import java Scanner 
- Throw and catches are used to catch an error and return a message without allowing the program to completely crash
- A Kotlin-Logger is added to the program to allow for logger information to be log onto the screen.
- Collection of Notes so that multiple Notes can be added to it.
- JUnit testing of all features in v2.0.
